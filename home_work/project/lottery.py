#  In this project, our proposal was to create a simulation using a lottery#
#    game in which the user is able to choose a randomly generated number  #
#    and compare it to the winning number utilizing a GUI. This simulation #
#    give the user a very efficient and visual representation as to how the#
#    lottery is played and how it works. Our Proposal to create this       #
#    program turned out to be very successful and create a working GUI in  #
#    which the user can interact with the GUI and the buttons and labels   #
#    and see how they can choose ( such as a quick pick ) when one goes    #
#    to a convenience store and choose a computer generated number and then#
#    they are able to compare their number with the winning number to see  #
#    if they won. This also shows the user just how complex it can be abd  #
#    the odds of all six numbers matching up is astronomically low to get  #
#    all the same numbers. with each of the regular balls having random    #
#    numbers ranging from 1-70 and the multiplier ball being from 1-25     #
#    makes the chances of hitting the JackPot almost close to NULL         #
